// Declare variables called country, continent and population and assign their values according to your own country (population in millions).

// Log their values to the console.

// United States
const country = ("United States");
console.log(country);

// North America
const continent = ("North America");
console.log(continent);

// Population
let population = 334000000;
console.log(population);

// Declare a variable called isIsland and set its value according to your country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable language, but don't assign it any value yet.

const isIsland = false;
let language;

// Log the types of isIsland, population, country and language to the console.

console.log(typeof isIsland);
console.log(typeof population);
console.log(typeof country);
console.log(typeof language);

// let, const and var
// Set the value of language to the language spoken where you live (some countries have multiple languages, but just choose one).

language = "English";

// Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.

// Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens.
console.log(country);
console.log(language);
